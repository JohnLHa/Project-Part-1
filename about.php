<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
	Urbane Nails is a family owned nail salon committed to making you have the prettiest 
	and healthiest nails in the WORLD.
</p>
<p>
	We cater to everyone, regardless of race, sex, age, or religion. We do have K-Love playing
	24-7 in the background for a soothing environment.
</p>
<p>
	If you come to our shop, you'll notice that we have 3 large televisions which we use to keep
	up to date on the news as well as important shows like Ellen DeGeneres' show as well as 
	Judge Judy. Channels are subject to change upon client request.
</p>
<p>
	We understand that not everyone will come to the nail salon to get their nails done,
	so we have a waiting area with plenty of seats and magazines for entertainment. We also
	offer bathroom facilities for anyone in need of using one.
</p>
<p>
	We love to hear your stories! Please strike a conversation with us while we do your nails. 
</p>
<p>
	If we're speaking in Vietnamese, we promise that there's a 95% chance we're not speaking ill 
	of you...unless you deserve it. Then the percentage rises.
